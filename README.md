# GPS-Program
The purpose of the code is to use an adjacency list to build City and Map
objects with the end of finding the shortest route to a destination from a 
starting place of our choosing. Using the connections already established within 
the code it will find a route between both locations. The program will run 
through the terminal using 'python3 gps_routes.py' --starting_city(input the 
chosen start) --destination_city(input the chosen destination)'.
